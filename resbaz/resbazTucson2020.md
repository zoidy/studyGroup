## Workshop/Course Descriptions

This year's Research Bazaar has been moved totally online. In an effort to mitigate "Zoom fatigue", it will be spread over two weeks, instead of 3 days as originally planned. Details to follow!

## What

The Research Bazaar is a worldwide festival promoting the digital literacy emerging at the center of modern research. Throughout 2020, events are happening at university campuses around the globe.

ResBaz Tucson is a free, multi-day intensive conference where researchers come together to up-skill in "next generation digital research tools and skills." In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun!

Who should attend? Researchers at ALL levels from ALL disciplines. PhD and research master's students are especially encouraged to attend. Research technologists who support researchers to do their job should also come along!
